# VCRC
 A vapor compression refrigeration cycle model which uses 4 functions representing the 4 major components of a VCRC: the compressor, condenser, evaporator, and expansion device. The four functions are used in conjunction with the thermodynamic values of the refrigerant (R-410a) and air in an interior point method optimization to minimize the norm of the mass and energy deficits.
